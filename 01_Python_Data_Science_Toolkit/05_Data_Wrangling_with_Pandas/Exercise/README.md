# Data Manipulation with pandas DataFrame 
![GitHub Logo](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/greyatom-social/GreyAtom-logo.png)

Many real-world data sets contain strings, integers, time-stamps and unstructured data. How do you store data like this so that you can manipulate it and easily retrieve important information? The answer is in a pandas DataFrame!

## Why complete this?
* You will become acquainted with the powertool of pandas - the DataFrame. You will learn how to use pandas to import and then inspect a variety of datasets.

* Having learned the fundamentals of working with DataFrames, you will now move on to more advanced indexing techniques. These are powerful techniques that allow you to tidy and rearrange your data into the format that allows you to most easily analyze it for insights.

## Learning Objective

## Project 
In IPL teams representing Indian cities contend each year. Chris Gayle is the highest run scorer in IPL. Do you know who is the second highest run scorer (without using ‘for’ loop)? This module can help you determine the second highest run scorer by manipulating large data sets to extract business insights.

*This project challenges you to manipulate large datasets without using conventional programming techniques to extract business insights.*
