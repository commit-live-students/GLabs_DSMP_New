## Why complete this?
Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns.

Why is it important?
* Patterns emerge quickly
* Exceptions and Outliers are Made Obvious
* Aids faster decision making 
* Clarify which factors influence behavior

## Learning Objective
After this lesson, you'll be able to
* Provide a stronger foundation in data visualization in Python
* Following a review of basic plotting with Matplotlib, this chapter delves into customizing plots using Matplotlib. 
* Showcases various techniques for visualizing two-dimensional arrays
* Customizing graphics, plotting two-dimensional arrays (e.g., pseudocolor plots, contour plots, images, etc.)
* Customizing statistical graphics (e.g., visualizing distributions & regressions)

## Project 
In IPL teams representing Indian cities contend each year. Chris Gayle is the highest run scorer in IPL. Do you know who is the second highest run scorer (without using ‘for’ loop)? This module can help you determine the second highest run scorer by manipulating large data sets to extract business insights.

By completing this project you have an opportunity to win 400 points!

*This project challenges you to manipulate large datasets without using conventional programming techniques to extract business insights.*
